## ideal app 

[precursor wireframe](https://precursorapp.com/document/Untitled-17592206483653)
This is the outline of our ideal version of time align.

### things to change from current alpha
- action button
- list page nesting and list item
- zoom and day nav buttons
- menu
- day visualization
- dashboard
- offline support (analytics fixes)

### things to add to current alpha
- inline period add dialogue
- general filter component with dialogue
  - dispatches re-frame events to set view state for sorting and filtering
  - components subscribe to view state and use to filter
- calendar page (and dashboard item)
- schedule
- quick buttons

### schedule entity fields
- category\_id
- task\_id
- frequency
  - weekly on MTWTFSS
  - monthly on 1-31 (if months doesn't have 29-31 default to last)
- duration
  - store as ms
- start
  - date scheduled tasks start
- stop 
  - date schedule tasks stop (defaults to 1 year)
  - has to allow at least one frequency (enforce in spec?)
- planned by default

On save will create all periods and add a `scheduled_id` field to them. Deleting the scheduled entity will delete all periods.  
Should not display scheduled entities whos stop date is past (or filtered easily)
  
### quick entity fields
- category\_id
- task\_id
- duration
- time\_of\_day
  - now
  - ms ago
  - time from now
  - 00:00 - 23:59
- default description
- emoji icon (b/w icons set colored by category)
- planned?



## road map
- (11/31) get the client to a payable state/milestone-2
  - everything in ideal but scheduled/quick buttons
- (12/31) implement backend
  - persistance & sync
  - user managment (google oauth)
  - integrate stripe
