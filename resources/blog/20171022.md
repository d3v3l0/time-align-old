### remote workflow
> "investing in new tooling to increase synergistic performance!" - Mark

- discord   : Video/Voice calling with screen sharing options in a dedicated electron app. (no hangouts multiple chrome windows)
- browser   : Test web app, access trello and github
- trello    : Coordinate tasks and accumulate resources
- github    : Source version control (use single branch upstream with PRs from local forks)
- editor    : Each person can use their own as long as it is floobits compatible (emacs, intelli-j, atom ...)
- floobits  : The greatest thing since sliced bread (enables paired coding sessions in users own client editor)
- gitkraken : Best GUI for git there is
- tmux      : Good way to manage vagrant vm windows
- vagrant   : isolated development environment with the ability to compile production deliverables
