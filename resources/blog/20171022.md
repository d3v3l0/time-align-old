## notes
### deploy production
- bring up vagrant machine
```
vagrant up
```

- in a sperate shell set up rsync
```
vagrant rsync-auto
```

- ssh into vm using start script (linux shown)
```
bash start.sh 
```

- navigate to time-align
```
cd time-align
```

- compile uberjar
```
lein uberjar
```

- navigate to jar
```
cd target/uberjar
```

- run jar in vm (to test)
```
java -jar time-align.jar
```

- move jar to local machine
```
??? compile it on your local machine
```

- scp it onto the droplet
```
scp local/location/time-align.jar time-align@timealign.io:~/rename-jar-with-version.jar
```

- create tmux session (if it doesn't exist)
```
tmux new -s time-align

```

- attach to tmux session (if it already exists)
```
tmux attach -t time-align
```

- make sure database url is set in envar
```
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://localhost/time_align_DBNAME_HERE?user=USERNAME_HERE&password=PASSWORD_HERE" 
``` 

- run jar
```
java -jar rename-jar-with-version.jar
```

### remote workflow
> "investing in new tooling to increase synergistic performance!" - Mark

- discord   : Video/Voice calling with screen sharing options in a dedicated electron app. (no hangouts multiple chrome windows)
- browser   : Test web app, access trello and github
- trello    : Coordinate tasks and accumulate resources
- github    : Source version control (use single branch upstream with PRs from local forks)
- editor    : Each person can use their own as long as it is floobits compatible (emacs, intelli-j, atom ...)
- floobits  : The greatest thing since sliced bread (enables paired coding sessions in users own client editor)
- gitkraken : Best GUI for git there is
- tmux      : Good way to manage vagrant vm windows
- vagrant   : isolated development environment with the ability to compile production deliverables
